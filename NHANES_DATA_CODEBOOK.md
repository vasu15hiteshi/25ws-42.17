## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Data Patterns
- **Empty cells**: Question was skipped due to survey logic (e.g., pregnancy questions for males)
- **7 = Refused**: Participant declined to answer
- **9 = Don't know**: Participant unsure of answer
- **Very small numbers** (e.g., 5.397605346934028e-79): May represent special missing codes

### Special Considerations
1. **Skip patterns**: Many questions only asked if previous answers meet criteria
2. **Age restrictions**: Some questionnaires only for certain age groups
3. **Proxy responses**: Some data from family members for young children
4. **Survey weights**: Available for population-representative estimates (not included in these simplified files)
